Brainstorming for a better crypto currency. 

Why
---
Crypto currencies are awesome, there is no doubt about where this world is going. In maybe 20 or 30 years we would be (or should be) trading in crypto more than we are today trading in actual currency. but sadly the present coins (mostly all derived from the Bitcoin architecture) have some severe short comings. I maybe right or I maybe wrong  but one can't argue that we should look for a better one with less shortcomings.

What
----

Few ideas collected from few discussions.

* [1] Limited and Unlimited supply : Both limiting the supply permanently and making  it unlimited is a bad idea. So need a better logic such as linking the amount in circulation to the number of users or something like that makes economic sense.

* [2] Non - Burnable : All the present coins are lost to the entire network if they go missing. So there should be a mechanism to resupply the network with these lost coins.

* [3] Hording : while in some ways hording is a good idea hording money may not be the best practice always for the community/network so hording currency for long time (in years) should be prevented. But also a mechanism need to be put in place that allow people to save their earnings. 
[ No : Idea how effectively we can make this happen]

* [4] Need to store all transactions : As the transactions increase and more coins are produced in time the data that a full node has to store will cross all sensible boundaries and we will need to put in place Master/Super nodes. Once this happens less and less users will maintain a full node. This could be bad for the network as the number of nodes that have the full data reduce the chances of different kinds of attack will increase. 

* [5] Secure Units : Need to make it madatory to lock the coins using a password or other methods as to reduce chances of wallet theft.

Ideas can be added as new .md files and can me linked to from this README with appropriate description under proper subsections.
